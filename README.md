This repo contains my DeepAcTS implementation, in addition to the modified version of Himst and Lanillos's Deep Active Inference agent, found here: https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.03622. The modified version of their agent uses my means of calculating the KL divergence and negative log likelihood.

To recreate Figure 5.3, run DeepAcTS/AI_noisy_obs_agent_AcT.py. This is my DeepAcTS implementation. 

To recreate Figures 5.4 and 5.5, Modified_Himst_and_Lanillos/run ai_mdp_agent.py and Modified_Himst_and_Lanillos/ai_pomdp_agent_noise.py (respectively). These are the default and modified versions of Himst and Lanillos's agent (respectively).
